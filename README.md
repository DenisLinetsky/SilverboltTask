# SilverboltTask
We are a cyber defense software and service company. As you know in the cyber world all that can go wrong will go wrong. We need to test our products with many cases as required, the only way to do that is by automation. The following task is to demonstrate the style of tasks you will need to handle here (at least some of them). We generated a simple application that you require to test. The application will watch a specific folder to file changes and will look for dirty files (more info in the application help).  To run the tested application:  Using compiled code Go to the right distribution under "dist" folder Download the relevant executable From source code Clone the repository Open console in the cloned folder Run "npm install" Run "node ." to see the application CLI options
